    SuSE Proxy-Suite comes with a fairly comprehensive
    documentation.  We have created UNIX style Man-Pages and
    some background information in the form of White Papers.

    This software is <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open
    Source </A> and released under the GPL
    (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</A> General Public License).
    The entire Proxy-Suite has been written from scratch by
    Volker Wiegand, with active help from Jens-Gero Boehm, Marius
    Tomaschewski and Pieter Hollants.
    <P>
    The FTP-Proxy is already in a usable state.  The only features
    that are announced but not implemented (yet) are the RFC
    1579 and 2428 extensions.
    <P>
    Everyone is invited to download, test and use this software for
    free.  We believe that it is in a fairly complete and usable
    shape.  Of course we are also very much interested in discussing
    enhancements and other components to include in the Proxy-Suite.
