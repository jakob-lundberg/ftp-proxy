  SuSE FTP-Proxy -- run level script
  Marius Tomaschewski <mt@suse.de>


  This version provides a *sample* LSB run-level script for
  (SuSE) Linux: rc.script. It allows you to start the proxy
  in daemon mode in a chroot runtime enviroment as well as
  in "normal" standalone / daemon mode.
  It also creates the complete chroot environment for you.

  The run-level script is very blown and tries to handle
  some different settings, like LogDestination, PidFile,
  TCPWrapper, LDAPServer, User, Group, Messages.

  If you do not like this script, write your own one :-)

  Note: this script needs case-sensitive config variable
        names - do not try to use ``serverroot创 instead
        of ``ServerRoot创.

  The script uses the ServerRoot chroot setting in the
  ftp-proxy.conf configuration file and allows you to
  use the built-in ftp-proxy to chroot mechanisms or via
  external compartment tool by Marc Heuse.

  The benefit of compartment usage is that compartment
  cleanups the enviroment, does a chroot, changes the
  group, sets kernel capabilities and _after_ all the
  steps are done, executes the daemon inside of this
  environment.
  The daemon runs with in the chroot with dropped root
  privileges, except of bind to a port lower than 1024
  (server port) and is able to write to files owned by
  himself (root).

  If you decide to use the compartment tool, set (add)
  the FTP_PROXY_CAPS variable to "yes".

  The config steps in /etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf:

  * Set ``ServerType to创 'standalone' (otherwise the
    script refuses to start).

  * Set a directory with ``ServerRoot创, i.e. the
    default directory '/var/lib/ftp-proxy/rundir'.

  * Set a ``Group创, the proxy should run as (i.e.
    'ftpproxy').

  * Set a ``User创, the proxy should run as (i.e.
    'ftpproxy').

  * Set a ``LogDestination创. The proxy supports logging
    to a pipe - the script doesn't support it, so you
    have to use a file (i.e. '/var/log/ftp-proxy.log')
    or a syslog facility (i.e. 'daemon').
    If you are using a file, allways set an absolute name;
    both, the script and the ftp-proxy need this.
    If you are using a syslog facility, you have to say
    syslogd to create a log-socket inside of the chroot
    environment - simply add it to the SYSLOGD_PARMS
    variable in /etc/rc.config, i.e.:
    SYSLOGD_PARMS="-a /var/lib/ftp-proxy/rundir/dev/log"

  * Set a ``DestinationAddress创 _OR_ enable the new
    transparent proxying feature with ``AllowTransProxy创
    (see TransProxy-Mini-Howto.txt).

  * Make other settings you need/like...

  That's all - now start the script with:

      /sbin/rcftp-proxy chroot

  and it will create a chroot enviroment for you with
  all needed files (I hope ;-) inside. Now, you can
  start the proxy with:

      /sbin/rcftp-proxy start

  and TEST if it does what you want - if not, read
  the documentation and double-check your settings.

  You can take a look into the configuration file inside
  of the chroot environment (with the above settings it
  is /var/lib/ftp-proxy/rundir/etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf).
  Some of your settings are not there (ServerRoot, User,
  Group) if you are using compartment tool and not the
  built-in chroot of the ftp-proxy (see above).

  Please contact proxy-suite@suse.com if you have any ideas,
  additions or corrections to this text, the script or the
  ftp-proxy. You can also purchase support or consulting
  services; contact solutions@suse.de or bsupport@suse.de.
