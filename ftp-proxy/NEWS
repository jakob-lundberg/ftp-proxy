   to allow email-adresses as username if UseMagicChar is @.

 - fixed to use hls->retr instead of a static retry counter

* 1.9         - released 2002-05-02
-----------------------------------

 - updated documentation, merged with v1.8.2.2 fixes


* 1.8.2.2     - released 2002-04-23

   observed in particular on Solaris should be catched propelly now

-----------------------------------

 - implemented config file wildcard-section names matching
 - minor and cosmetic fixes from patches flying arround


* 1.8.0       - released 2002-01-14
-----------------------------------
 - implemented transparent proxying support for Linux ipchains/iptables
   and BSD ipf/ipnat - read description in TransProxy-Mini-Howto.txt
 - implemented workarround for Netscape (4.x) to access directories
   via symbolic link (see also new FailResetsPasv config option)
 - implemented LDAPBindDN and LDAPBindPW simple bind authorization
 - fixed ld_errno fetching macro to work with openldap 2.x
 - fixed build-in chroot and uid/gid dropping - now, the whole daemon
   runs in the chroot; log is written with uid/gid set in config file
 - fixed socket_gets to wait for a complete line if no EOL found
 - added MaxRecvBufSiz config option allowing to limit the revc buffer
 - added LogLevel config option allowing to set the maximal level
 - extended log messages to provide basic transfer statistics data
 - extended / improved auto-configure checks for better portability

* 1.7.8 (tp8) - released 2001-09-19
-----------------------------------
 - fixed sample run level script to be LSB compliant (I hope it is now)
 - added Solaris FIONREAD (broken pipe) patch from Stefan Landvoigt


* 1.7.7 (tp7) - released 2001-06-20
-----------------------------------
 - the proxy uses ip address fetched with getsockname from the control
   socket to the client for data communications. In transparent mode,
   this may cause problems with ip filters, because getsockname returns
   the address of the ftp server the client means it is connected to
   (see also "netstat -atn" output).
   Now, the proxy prefers to use the IP set via listen in the config;
   if no Listen is set, ip address from getsockname is used, so "Listen"
   and in some environments also TranslatedAddress should be set.
 - added socket_sck2addr CTAGS_OPTS typo and SockBindRand config_int
   vs. config_bool patch from Andrea. thanx!


* 1.7.6 (tp6) - released 2001-06-05
-----------------------------------
   - added sample rc.config.ftp-proxy and rc.script.ftp-config
   - implemented LDAPBindDN, LDAPBindPW for authenticated simple bind
   - autoconf ctags, ftp-proxy.conf.sample cleanups
   - fixed QUIT to be allowed every time
   - fixed pid file creation order to be before UID 0 is dropped
   - fixed ActivePort default to be INPORT_ANY (random port)
     if not running as UID 0 (root) instead of IPPORT_FTP - 1 (port 20)
     an no ActiveMinDataPort/ActiveMaxDataPort given
   - fixed (I hope ;-) bind/connect problems (see also SockBindRand option)
   - added patch for infinite-loop bug in telnet control handling
   - added patch for unneeded exit in socket_sck2addr and on client fork failure
   - added patch for clean up the PID of a child in daemon array (MaxClients)
   - added contributors to CREDITS file
