*	Implement a destination control (using TCP wrapper?)
	used in transparent proxy and magic user modes

*	Implement a simple bandwidth limiter

*	Implement APSV as defined in rfc1579:
	 - Client sends APSV (all passive) on begin of a session
	 - Proxy allways does a passive open (on client-side)
	   if not preceded by an explicite PORT or PASV
	 - Proxy sends CODE 151 (IP+port) as response for all
	   file transfer requests not preceded by a PORT or PASV
	 - PORT overrides APSV-mode for next transfer operation

*	Implement IPv6 FTP extensions as defined in rfc2428

*	Include support for Kerberos.

*	Allow also scp (Secure Copy) for both the client and
	server connection.

*	Include support for SSL (the OpenSSL example code
	includes an FTP client and server).
	Alas, the legal implications have to be considered !!!

*	Find a way to base the per user rules retrieved from
	an LDAP server not only on the user name, but also
	on the client address (with variable masks).
