<P>The following discussion assumes that you have obtained the
tarball distribution and want to compile and install the FTP-Proxy
package from ground up.  Let's assume you have received a file named
<CODE>proxy-suite-x.y.tar.gz</CODE>, where 'x' is the major and 'y'
is the minor version number.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Decide where to install and compile the source code.  Say you want
to install it in <CODE>/usr/src/proxy-suite-x.y</CODE>.  Then do the
following to unpack the source (assuming the tarball is available
in the current directory when calling gunzip):

<PRE>
cd /usr/src
gunzip -c proxy-suite-x.y.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>


If you do not have a copy of GZIP, look at the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gzip/">GNU</A>
archive or one of its numerous mirrors.  It's free.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>After unpacking the source you need to run the <CODE>configure</CODE>
shell script which performs the customization for you operating
system and local environment.  This script is based upon the GNU
AutoConf package.  Change your current directory to be the root of
the Proxy-Suite:

<PRE>
cd proxy-suite-x.y
</PRE>


The <CODE>configure</CODE> script understands a number of options
which control the customization process.  To see a complete list
of all options simply run:

<PRE>
./configure --help
</PRE>


The following options are most likely to be involved:

<PRE>
--prefix=&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the root directory for the installation.  If none of the
other directory related directives further down is also given,
all files will be installed in subdirectories under this one.
The default is <CODE>/usr/local/proxy-suite/</CODE>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--exec-prefix=&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A second top level installation directory, this one is used as
the basis for all executables.  Defaults to the same as PREFIX.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--mandir=&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The FTP-Proxy comes with two manual pages:
<EM>ftp-proxy(8)</EM> for the program
and <EM>ftp-proxy.conf(5)</EM> for the configuration file format.
These will be installed under the <CODE>man5</CODE> and <CODE>man8</CODE>
subdirectories of the given one, or under <CODE>PREFIX/man</CODE> if
not specified.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--sbindir=&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The next directory specifies the location where the
<CODE>ftp-proxy</CODE> executable itself will be installed.  The
default is <CODE>EXEC-PREFIX/sbin</CODE> if this option does not
request otherwise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--sysconfdir=&lt;directory&gt;
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The last directory related option (others may be given, but
have no effect) deals with the <CODE>proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf</CODE>
configuration file.  Again there is a default if the option is
not provided, <CODE>PREFIX/etc</CODE>.
Please note that the location of the config file can be selected
at run time with the <EM>-f</EM> flag, but if the file is
installed at the default location, this flag is redundant.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--enable-debug
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option allows the generation of debugging output and
is mainly included for evaluation (and development) purposes.
It is recommended not to specify this option for deployment
of the FTP-Proxy into production environments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--enable-warnings
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If compiling with the GNU GCC compiler, this flag increases
the warning level.  This is useful to detect programming
errors or incompatibilities with the target platform.  Our
recommendation is to enable it anyway.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--enable-so-linger
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is strongly recommended to enable this option for all systems.
Only if the target does have problems with <EM>SO_LINGER</EM>
handling, it should be disabled.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--with-regex[=PATH]
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option is mainly needed to provide the location of the
POSIX 1002.3 regular expression library if it is not included
in the standard C library.  Regular expressions are used to
scan the arguments of the various FTP commands received from
clients.  If your system does not include the required support,
you can download the latest version from the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/regex/">GNU</A>
archive.  Again, it's free.  GNU RegEx is known to work with
FTP-Proxy.  If the option is not given, regular expression
support is not installed at all and arguments will not be
investigated any further.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--with-libwrap[=PATH]
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If running as a standalone background daemon, FTP-Proxy can be
instructed to make use of the <EM>TCP Wrapper</EM> library.
If this is compiled in and enabled in the configuration file,
the <CODE>/etc/hosts.allow</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/hosts.deny</CODE>
files will be consulted to decide if a client will be served.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--with-libldap[=PATH]
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you want to supply the user specific configuration values
(not the basic ones) via an LDAP directory, compile in LDAP
support.  The <CODE>configure</CODE> script can determine without
further manual intervention whether to use the <EM>OpenLDAP</EM>,
the <EM>University of Michigan</EM> or the <EM>Netscape</EM>
version of the API. <EM>OpenLDAP</EM> is the preferred API.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<PRE>
--with-crypt[=PATH]
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This option enables support for crypted passwords in user
authentication (curently ldap based only).  See also the
<CODE>LDAPAuthPWType</CODE> configuration file option.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI>After <CODE>configure</CODE> has completed successfully, it is now
time to run <CODE>make</CODE> (GNU make). It will read the
<CODE>Makefile</CODE> generated by <CODE>configure</CODE> in the previous
step and perform the compilation process. The program should not
display any warnings or errors.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the executables have been generated, a final call to
<CODE>make install</CODE> will copy the FTP-Proxy files into their
appropriate places.  Usually root privileges are required in
order to install the files in their proper places.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Currently, you'll have to modify your system manually so that
ftp-proxy is run at system bootup or from inetd (depending on
which mode you choose in the configuration file or command line).
We provide an sample run level script <CODE>rc.script</CODE> for
(SuSE) Linux; see also description in <CODE>rc.script.txt</CODE>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The last step is the configuration of the installed FTP-Proxy;
see following 
<A HREF="ftp-proxy-3.html#config">Configuration</A> section.</LI>
